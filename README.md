# Meal Swipes

I want to use all 400 of my meal swipes on the meal plan that I’m required to be on. That’s a lot.

To achieve this goal, I made this webpage, which shows me how many swipes I’ve used and how many I should’ve used at this point.

The number of meal swipes used are scraped from JumboCash and stored in [this GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/benborgers/f87b1fb5b39209697c156bded77fe23d), so they can be loaded by the website.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
